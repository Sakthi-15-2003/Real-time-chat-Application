              WORK SUMMARY:

Nebula Chat — Real-Time Chat Application

Nebula Chat is a responsive, visually polished real-time chat interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It leverages the WebSocket API to simulate real-time messaging, complete with animated message bubbles, user avatars, typing indicators, and dynamic message history.

This chat app is designed to offer a sleek, modern user experience with a glassmorphism-style UI, adaptable layouts, and soft gradient themes. It provides a hands-on demo of real-time communication features that are foundational in modern web applications.


          Key Features:

Real-Time Messaging
Messages are sent and received instantly using a WebSocket connection (wss://echo.websocket.org) that echoes the user’s message to simulate a live conversation.

Glassmorphism Interface
The design uses blurred backgrounds, soft shadows, and vibrant gradients for a premium look.

Typing Indicator
Simulates user activity with a smooth, animated "typing..." indicator when input is detected.

Message Timestamps
Every message includes a clearly formatted timestamp for better context.

User Avatars & Online Status
Displays a mock list of online users with profile icons and green status dots.

Mobile-Responsive Layout
Optimized for all screen sizes—sidebars collapse on mobile, and messages remain readable and accessible.

            Built With:

HTML5 – Semantic structure and layout

CSS3 – Gradient backgrounds, responsive grid, and modern UI styling

JavaScript – WebSocket handling, DOM interaction, animation

WebSocket API – Real-time data simulation
